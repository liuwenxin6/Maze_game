# Maze_game
Final project for csc16 (intro to c++) from Spring 2019

This maze game displays the maze in a 2d fashion based off the base given by the professor. The maze is presented with 1 & 0 to indicate walls and possible path; * represents path the user came from, and # represents the user's current position. The user can choose to go up, down, left, right, and diagonal steps. The game will congrats the user when the exit of the maze is reached.

Please see sample output in comments by the end of the "readMyMaze_Liu.cpp" file for demonstration.
